      		<h2 class="title">10 Best Design Resources</h2>

	 <div class="docs-section" id="queries">
	  <p>As a designer, there are so many creative assets that we use on a day-to-day basis whether it's fonts, icons, stock images, or even something as simple as choosing our colors. If you’re like me, you spend a lot of time trying to find the perfect pattern, the finest font, and the coolest color combo. Whether you’re just starting out or have been designing for years, all these resources are a must-have in your design toolbox. Here are ten of my favorite resources: <br><br></p>
      
	  <h6 class="docs-header">1. Coolors.co</h6>
	  <img class="u-full-width" src="./images/coolors.gif" alt="coolors gif">
      <p><br>Whether you’re creating a logo, designing a website, or defining a brand identity, color plays a vital role in any design project. There are a variety of color resources out there to choose from but <a href="https://coolors.co/cabac8-ff101f-b2ddf7-81d6e3-4cb5ae" target="_blank">Coolors</a> is one of my personal favorites, especially if you're hitting a creative block. Coolors is designed to generate five colors that work well together at the press of your spacebar.<br><br>If you come across a color that you like, you can lock it and keep hitting the spacebar to generate four new complementary colors around it. Coolors lets you export, store, and reuse your palette in tools like Adobe. Coolors also has a mobile app, so you can review and modify your colors from anywhere.<br><br></p>
	  
	  <h6 class="docs-header">2. undraw</h6>
	  <img class="u-full-width" src="./images/undraw.png" alt="undraw site">
      <p><br><a href="https://undraw.co" target="_blank">unDraw</a> is a great place to get open source, free, theemable illustrations. I use unDraw for almost all of my projects. They are perfect for the web with their small file size and unlimited scalability. You can download these illustrations in SVG or PNG and they roll out new illustrations every day.<br><br></p>
		 
	   <h6 class="docs-header">3. Google Fonts</h6>
	  <img class="u-full-width" src="./images/google_fonts.png" alt="google fonts">
      <p><br><a href="https://fonts.google.com" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a> is typically my go to resource for fonts. Not only do they have a wide range of fonts to match whatever brand you're working on, but they provide them for free along with the <code>@import url</code> to easily use the fonts on your website.<br><br></p>
		 
	  <h6 class="docs-header">4. Box Icons, Feather Icons, & Icon Jar</h6>
	  <img class="u-full-width" src="./images/box-icons.png" alt="box icons and feather icons">
      <p><br>When it comes to icons, <a href="https://boxicons.com" target="_blank">Box Icons</a> and <a href="https://feathericons.com" target="_blank">Feather Icons</a> are my favorite resources. Collectively, they have nearly 1,000 icons to choose from so with a library that large, you're destined to find the right icons for your project. If you want to take it a step further, I highly recommend downloading <a href="https://geticonjar.com" target="_blank">Icon Jar</a>. This will allow you to store all of your icons in one place and makes finding your icons extremely easy.<br><br></p>
		 
	  <h6 class="docs-header">5. Collect UI</h6>
	  <img class="u-full-width" src="./images/collectui.png" alt="collect ui inspiration">
      <p><br><a href="http://collectui.com/" target="_blank">Collect UI</a> is an archive that is updated daily with some of the best UI from thousands of designers and provides a ton of great inspiration. They have over 160 categories to choose from so you're able to get inspiration on things as specific as a scroll transition or even a design for an e-wallet.<br><br></p>
		 
	  <h6 class="docs-header">6. Unsplash</h6>
	  <img class="u-full-width" src="./images/unsplash.png" alt="unsplash free stock images">
      <p><br>When it comes to free stock photos, there is no better place than <a href="http://collectui.com/" target="_blank">Unsplash</a>. All photos published on Unsplash are completely free and can be used for commercial and noncommercial purposes.<br><br></p>
		 
	  <h6 class="docs-header">7. Interfacer (Mockups)</h6>
	  <img class="u-full-width" src="./images/interfacer.png" alt="interfacer free mockups">
      <p><br>If I'm looking for some free mockups, I'll usually head over to <a href="https://interfacer.xyz/" target="_blank">Interfacer</a> or <a href="https://www.cerpow.com/" target="_blank">Cerpow</a>. These two sites provide a huge library of free mockups for just about any type of asset that you're looking for.<br><br></p>
		 
	  <h6 class="docs-header">8. Kraken.io</h6>
	  <img class="u-full-width" src="./images/kraken.png" alt="kraken image compressor">
      <p><br>If you're a web developer, you know how important it is to keep your image file sizes slim. <a href="https://kraken.io/web-interface" target="_blank">Kraken</a> is my favorite resource for cutting down file sizes without ruining the quality of your photo and is great for improving or keeping your page speed high.<br><br></p>
		 
	  <h6 class="docs-header">9. Favicon Generator</h6>
	  <img class="u-full-width" src="./images/favicon-generator.png" alt="favicon generator">
      <p><br><a href="https://realfavicongenerator.net/" target="_blank">Favicon Generator</a> is a great resource if you're a web developer and want to speed up the process of installing all of your favicon elements. Within five minutes, this tool will generate all of your favicon assets, links, and meta data leaving you the task of copy/pasting the code and uploading the files. It's really that easy.<br><br></p>
		 
	  <h6 class="docs-header">10. Hemingway Editor</h6>
	  <img class="u-full-width" src="./images/hemingway.png" alt="hemigway editor">
      <p><br>If you're a designer who also writes a lot of copy, then I cannot stress this enough. <a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/" target="_blank">Hemingway</a> is one of the best tools out there to audit your text and make sure that what you are writing is easy to read. Copy and paste your text into Hemingway's easy-to-use editor and it will tell you your readability grade level, how much passive voice you used, or even how many of your sentences are hard to read.<br><br></p>
